A greasemonkey/tempermonkey script that helps filling in travel expenses in QUT's iexpense webform


## Installing and Using Tampermonkey
Unlike Greasemonkey, which only runs on Firefox, Tampermonkey is available for a wide range of web browsers. What is similar to Greasemonkey, however, is that the Tampermonkey add-on is also managed through the menu associated with its address bar button. From here you can toggle its functionality off and on, check for updates, create your own user script as well as open a dashboard where you can manage Tampermonkey's settings as well as all scripts that have been installed.

To install Tampermonkey on Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Dolphin (Android only) or UC Browser (Android only), visit the extension's webpage at https://tampermonkey.net/ and follow the instructions specific to your browser.
